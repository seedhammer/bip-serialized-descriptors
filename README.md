## Serialization of Bitcoin Output Descriptors

This is a rough Go implementation of https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/issues/135.

Run it with

```sh
$ go run github.com/seedhammer/bip-serialized-descriptors@main
```

It can also be used from the Go playground: https://go.dev/play/p/nouZlbbcEWt.
